This repository contains Java programs focused on array manipulation and problem-solving techniques, implemented as part of my programming practice and learning journey. The project demonstrates different approaches to array rotation and element frequency analysis using efficient logic and algorithmic concepts.

📌 Topics Covered:

Anticlockwise array rotation (without reverse method)

Anticlockwise array rotation using the reversal algorithm

Clockwise array rotation using reverse technique

Finding frequency of a specific element in an array

Counting occurrences of all elements in an array

💡 The programs emphasize:

Understanding array traversal

Optimizing rotation using reversal algorithms

Nested loop logic for frequency counting

Beginner-friendly implementation using Java and Scanner input handling

This repository is part of my continuous coding practice to strengthen Data Structures & Algorithms fundamentals and improve problem-solving skills in Java.
